I am a JavaScript developer specializing in React and Next.js, and a graphic designer with a passion for creating seamless and visually appealing user experiences. Studying branding at e-Youth has given me a strong foundation in crafting impactful brand identities. My skills in both development and design allow me to bring innovative ideas to life with technical expertise and creativity.
